### Technologies

The technology stack I used for this project includes Vue 3 as the framework, Vite as the build tool, JavaScript as the programming language, and SCSS for styling. It took me about 2 weeks to complete. This was my first experience with Vue as a developer and was mainly focused on gaining experience with the framework.
